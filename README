Audio Scraper is a simple console utility that saves the audio from a video file for use in listening to in iTunes.  It's totally a stupid mac thing, so sorry.
This is an example of using the AVFoundation API.

Audioscrape:

    Default Mode:
        audioscrape source.m4v dest.m4a

        In default mode, just treat the first 2 args like source video and dest audio.

    Batch Mode:
        audioscrape -b -e <num> -o <list of sources>  

        -b : enable batch mode

        Batch mode treats all the arguments like source .m4v files
        Destination filenames are inferred from each source path.

        -o : overwrite destination files

        By default audioscrape will not overwrite an existing file.

        -e <exporters> : define the number of exporters to use

        Each exporter seems to spawn about 8 threads each. The number of exporters is 32 by default.


Bugs:

    Large values to -e will cause segfaults, presumably due to the large number of threads created. Each exporter
    seems to create about 8 threads each.
